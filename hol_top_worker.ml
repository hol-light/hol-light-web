(* Web Worker entry: HOL Light kernel running in a worker thread.

   Streaming: the four jsoo Sys_js flushers post immediately, so the page
   sees output land as Format buffers flush.  HOL Light's bootstrap (the
   ~140s of "solved at N" lines) streams the same way because we install
   the flushers *before* JsooTop.initialize runs. *)

(* ---- 1b. HOL filesystem: synchronous fetch from same origin.

   `make site` deploys the parent HOL Light tree alongside this worker
   script, so a relative request "Library/words.ml" resolves against
   the worker's own URL (self.location.href).  That works whether the
   site is served from the host root (e.g. <origin>/) or a subpath
   (e.g. <origin>/hol-light-web/, which is how GitHub Pages deploys
   project sites).  Sync XHR is allowed inside Web Workers (it's only
   forbidden on the main thread), so loadt's expectation of synchronous
   Sys.file_exists/open_in is satisfiable.

   Once a file is fetched, jsoo caches it in its in-memory FS — so
   Digest.file works (loaded_files de-dup) and re-loadt is a no-op. *)

  http_fetch_sync path

(* Mount the deploy root at /hol/ rather than /.  jsoo's runtime already
   registers a default device at "/" during startup; a second mount at
   the same path is silently shadowed by the first (resolve_fs_device in
   fs.js prefers the earlier registration on equal-length prefixes), so
   Sys.file_exists "/meson.ml" would never reach our handler.  Mounting
   at /hol/ sidesteps the conflict; we then point HOL Light's $ at /hol
